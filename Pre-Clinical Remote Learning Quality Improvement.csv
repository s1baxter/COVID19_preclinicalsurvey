It is difficult to talk about motivational interviewing or other POM topics when there isn’t physical interaction, but more importantly it is often frustrating because many students aren’t inclined to participate as much which makes POM very difficult to get through. The lack of participation combined with the disengagement is difficult to overcome. 2) I think there should be more practice problems, subscriptions to question banks, or modules to engage students during this time. It is difficult to find motivation to study when there is no reinforcement. Besides the weekly quiz and 1-3 TBLs, students are expected to simply “master” lecture content by basically memorizing information. It would be nice if there were more virtual practice assessments or problems to allow students to feel like they are actually learning. Or if we could incorporate material into modules that may be beneficial. ",,"For me, it has been incredibly challenging to study from Graduate Housing and my parents home. I have tried both, and it seems that no matter where I go there are hurdles to overcome.

I think the latter experience was great because it was the closest to my ACA that I’ve gotten and I really hope we can do more of that. I’m really glad to be able to see patients through free clinic; While we can’t practice physical exam skills, we at least get to interact with our patients. I think these clinical experiences are REALLY helpful in keeping me engaged and in building the connection between the clinical world and our education. Helping patients set up with MCVV has also been a nice opportunity to just talk to patients and feel like I’m able to help contribute at this time and it’s been interesting to see what kind of challenges patients have to get video-enabled ","Flexibility and not having to come to campus every day (although, I would like to come to campus at least a few times a week for real-life interactions, structure, and hands-on learning) ","Clinical experiences, interactive hands-on experiences (e.g., ultrasound, ACA, POM/GOSCE w/physical exam and patient interaction) - which I know we can’t really do virtually. But I just want to make this note because, for me personally, a HUGE part of medical education that keeps me excited and motivated is everything that I learn from working with our attendings and residents. It really helps to integrate our preclinical learning as well. I miss my ACA more than anything. POM feels pretty ineffective through the remote learning tools because a lot of what we need to do requires in-person interaction. Anatomy: I’m glad we got through most of it in person, but it’s non-ideal to learn anatomy (personally) through digital images. If we can start safely re-introduce those experiences sooner than later, that would be AMAZING. ","Honestly, just the review sessions and podcast option for lectures (which we were already doing pre-quarantine). ","Remote learning is great when it’s a choice - podcast the lecture if you learn better that way. But for me personally, it’s been a struggle. I prefer the structure of getting up in the morning and going to lecture, attending small groups and interacting with people in real life. Could our schedule be optimized to maybe stack those interactions a few times a week and not necessarily go in every day? Sure. But there’s still a level of engagement in-person that I just don’t feel through this remote medium. That said, I want to recognize that we’re living in a very unique time that’s making it even harder to stay engaged. We’re all adjusting to this bizarre new normal of businesses being closed, not being able to leave the house, people avoiding eye contact in grocery stores, not being able to meet up with friends and family, and of course COVID that seems to have no end. It is very hard to stay focused when you are worried about loved ones or thinking about what you can do help in this situation. The desire to help with COVID but to realize we’re probably more helpful by staying out of the way is a little disempowering. At the same time, I also recognize that studying and doing well in school may just be the most important thing we do so we can help when our time comes. Nonetheless, it’s hard not to feel like we’re just sitting at home while our community (i.e., the medical community) is out on the frontlines. Also, like I said in another comment, the experience and wealth of knowledge we get from interacting with patients and interspersing clinical experiences throughout our week is irreplaceable. It’s humbling and motivating and keeps that fire burning.   I don’t know if I answered your question, but I guess the TLDR is that online learning (many lectures notwithstanding) can be supplemental but not a great replacement for medical school, which I think is most effective when it is as hands-on and interactive as possible. COVID is compounding this by making it literally impossible to do anything we’d normally do, so it’s going to take time to adjust. I look forward to the day we can get back to some semblance of normalcy. "
